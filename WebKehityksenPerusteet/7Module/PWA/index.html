        <h2>Mau mau</h2>
        <p>An orange-striped cat named Finn roamed a small town. Each day, he'd seek adventures, from the bakery's backdoor to the fisherman's wharf. Residents admired Finn for his tenacity; he wasn't just another housecat. One chilly morning, Finn discovered a strange box outside the library. Curious, he entered and got accidentally locked inside.</p>
        <p>Hours passed. Inside the box, Finn found a device emitting warm light. By evening, the box opened, revealing a completely new environment. Finn was now in a bustling city square surrounded by tall structures, unlike his small town. Overwhelmed but intrigued, Finn explored this new world. He navigated through traffic, avoided noisy children, and even discovered a delightful sushi bar.</p>
        <p>A week later, Finn stumbled upon another such box. Hoping to return home, he entered. This time, he found himself back in his familiar town, greeted by the worried townsfolk. The device he had discovered was a portal device lost by a visiting scientist. Finn's adventure was now a legend, and his bravery was celebrated annually, reminding everyone of the orange-striped cat who explored new worlds.</p>
